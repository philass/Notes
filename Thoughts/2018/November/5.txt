What did I do today?

I continue working through a youtube tutorial series about the MEAN stack. I connected to MongoDB, and implemented a post request with Node (all from the tutorial).

What did I learn?

I learned how to work with the Mongo shell. Some user authentication and some stuff about POST with Node.

Any takeaways from the day?

I was just happy that I was able to focus reasonbly well. Still trying to achieve the flow state. What I was really happy about was that I ran into some silly issues and I weathered the storm and pushed through instead of just giving up in typical Philip fashion. I actually did give up, but I came back to the task of debugging within 30 mins, which is better than nothing.
