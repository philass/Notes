What did I do today?

I started working on Get Lost. I decided that I wanted to use the MEAN stack, which constists of MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular, and NodeJS. I found a good Youtube series. I wasn't very productive but at least I started something that I could build on moving forward.


What did I learn?

I wouldn't say I neccesarily learned anything. I just started to get a feel for how the Software Stack might work and a general feel for programming with servers and Databases.

Any takeaways from the day?

Start good habit? Maybe with a good bed time.
