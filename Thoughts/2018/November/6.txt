What did I do today?

I spent a lot of time with family so I didn't really get the opportunity to do much. However on the train ride over I read a little about B-Trees. The most important thing I did, today was that I started reading. The book I am reading is about focus, and possibly has the potential to change my life (To Extreme??... Possibly).

What did I learn?

Just learned a little about the structure of B-Trees. Everything else was learned from the book "Deep Work".

Any takeaways from the day?

I need to spend more time working on my side projects and coding. That is starting to make me happy.
