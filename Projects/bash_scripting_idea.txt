Preamble

Bash scripting is an extremely useful skill! But the language is whack.
Its syntax in my opinion is extremely unintuitive. The only way I think
I can really learn the language and have it at my fingers when I need it
is by practicing it regularly. This means that I need to write scripts
multiple times per week. Here are some ideas of scripts I could write


- I have a common preamble in python files. Write a script to prepend
this preamble to a python function

- Automate 
  git add *
  git commit -m
  git push
